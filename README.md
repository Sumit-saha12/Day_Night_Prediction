# Dat Night Prediction

I have developed a Python tool using OpenCV to classify Day and Night in Time lapse videos.
Key steps in my approach:  
1️⃣ Extracted frames from the video.  
2️⃣ Converted frames into HSV format to check Saturation and Value.  
3️⃣ Define a threshold to classify each frame into time of day categories.
